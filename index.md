## Visuals in R, Python, and Power BI

In my master's program, I was tasked to create various graphs in Python, R, and Power BI. The experience gained me an appreciation of the pros and cons of each program. There are reasons to use all three programs and the best is dependent on the project. The graphs I created include bar charts, stacked bar charts, pie charts, heat maps, spatial charts, contour charts, histograms, box plots, bullet charts, line charts, step charts, scatterplots, bubble charts, density plots, tree maps, area charts, and stacked area charts.
